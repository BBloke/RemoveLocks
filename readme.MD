EvolutionCMS Plugin

This plugin was created to remove all locks from with EvolutionCMS (previous MDOX).
It should be used when "Remove Locks" option in the manager proves ineffective.

Problem:
When migrating an existing site to v3 some templates, template variables, snippets, chunks and plugins show (Locked) at the end of their name.
This causes the manager, when using the plugin ElementsInTree, to show a different list from the main Elements page.
i.e. the Left hand side doesnt match the right hand side.

Solution:
Use this plugin once to reset all the locks on the 5 tables relating to each element.

Works with: v1.4, v2.0.4 and v3
